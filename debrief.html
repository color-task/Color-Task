    <h3>Study Explanation</h3>
    
    <div style="width: 50vw;">
        This study examines how much visual perception depends on attention. Across many conditions, we show people a pair of concentric, colored rings and ask them to pay attention to the inner ring, the outer ring, or both. Later, we ask people to report one or both colors. Our procedures replicate a 2013 study by Eitam and colleagues that showed superior memory for the “attended” ring and worse memory for the “unattended” ring. This finding was interesting because it suggested a failure to encode and remember information that was fully visible and part of the display, but not relevant to the task. In that way, it is unlike other failures of awareness in which people fail to encode unexpected objects or changes. This study is part of a series of experiments in which we aim to replicate their result with an improved design that eliminates some possible alternative explanations. To learn from this study, it is essential that future participants not know of our goals or study design. Please do not share information about the experiment with your friends as that could undermine our data. If you have any questions, you can email Prof. Daniel Simons (prof.simons@gmail.com). Thank you for participating.
